The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions.

You can play it alone against one to three computer opponents or with a group of friends or family.  \r\n\r\nIn Ludo Supremo you must move all of your pieces from your yard into your home area. The first player to do so wins. To enter a piece into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If a player has no pieces in play they get 3 tries to get a 6. Once a player has one or more pieces in play, he selects a piece and moves it forward along the track the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Players must always move a piece according to the die value rolled, and if no move is possible, pass their turn to the next player. Any roll of a 6 allows you to roll again whether you can use the 6 or not. If the advance of a piece ends on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is returned to its owner's yard. A player can only move pieces in its home area with moves equal to the dice roll. Once all 4 pieces are in the home area the player wins. This may be different than some other Ludo games where the home is at end of the home area.\r\n\r\nSpend some quality family time playing Ludo Supremo today!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NT2SCS0304B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dora the Explorer Memory Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41886.14422104538678733.2954dff0-0417-4549-a875-176e11f18180.2e58dd53-0f91-47f8-8a86-a767e86c7721","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39388.14422104538678733.92d30f9d-cecf-4ddb-8a82-119c30443ebe.53691df7-8344-4467-8bff-46cc1d820919","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56820.14422104538678733.d3e3560a-8da3-4e29-8477-8e6d92e94c3f.decaaa9e-1aad-42f6-8150-f490ed2d5656","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["57493Valybonny.DoratheExplorerMemoryGame_k8ehae36r5j22"],"ContentIds":["a34a5ee4-3c6a-a6a4-47f5-8a623d85193e","b743bd4a-773c-e567-4895-1026b7006fc3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a \"Dora the explorer\" themed version of the classical Memory card game.\r\nThe object is to match more pairs of cards than the opposing player.\r\nIf you're playing alone, instead you just have to match all the pairs in the shortest time possible.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NTB4BNQB1RK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toon Cup: 2018","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64287.14417567739072816.54cbad01-4833-4814-8ee1-bd769383c6cb.126fe8f4-73f5-4902-b6c6-04c8cdf016fa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47478.14417567739072816.54cbad01-4833-4814-8ee1-bd769383c6cb.96a6c0c4-7826-4085-9314-88345c4dc9ff","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["39135goatgame.ToonCup2018_p6fh3swgmjcvc"],"ContentIds":["fd97a114-083b-02e1-79a5-6e709bbc8838","2ba51a6a-863f-f26d-677f-24c6fa06484d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play this completely FREE football game now.

Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree.

Be careful not to fly out of the road into the ocean.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PDFCVDVX3B1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Holy Armor: For Athena","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48776.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.741bcf66-8125-4db9-b0a3-84adf0cb589d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36137.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.9d19de99-2c7a-4818-883c-bb5a93e3df6a","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56177.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.31c76b5c-b675-4bcf-baad-de3e9f94d435","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36001.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.69c02f39-d494-41b0-877d-93931cf716b9","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17307.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.0e6467dd-d90e-49f0-9336-27b40edac007","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55683.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.4c8624b3-972e-4b59-8bbd-149108a9570a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9452.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.b39e256d-741e-4cc8-a353-4c1cd71edc00","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22838.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.37fdfcde-45bb-456b-ad37-5be8304a5292","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35814.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.5fe31da9-7f23-49b1-955e-c2d1e5cb3fe9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29481.14155625038171038.9520e727-d072-4af8-93be-e06b58052907.cfc5be8f-a98c-4a03-aa90-26f0e7752efa","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["42570KnightSpirit.AthenaMyth_mj22c2y3wwn28"],"ContentIds":["663d6bf2-ff60-97e9-c0ae-3ed918df5e9b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"That the app does not support Windows 10 S.\r\n\r\nHoly Armor: For Athena is an exciting ARPG that mixes Greek and Norse mythology.

Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n♣ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n♣ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible.

It uses unique spatial audio cues to signal to the player where they are in the play-space and where the main game object, the ball, is traveling.\r\n\r\nThe player controls a paddle from the first-person perspective. They can hear and/or see the ball traveling around the court, which is at eye level. The goal of the game is to hit the ball back and forth with a partner or computer player until one player misses the ball with their paddle; this scores a point for the other player. With each hit, the ball speeds up slightly, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement. The first player to score seven points wins the match.\r\n\r\nAudio feedback:\r\nBall audio – A fine-tuned combination of low-frequency humming and high-frequency ticking, along with other contextual sound effects, makes the ball easy to locate with audio alone\r\nPlayer location cues – Unique sounds indicating the side walls and center point of the court let the player know where they are at all times\r\nOpponent feedback – Similar “paddle impact” sounds play for both the player and their opponent, indicating when and where the opponent has hit the ball","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PN25V5XBLLJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Clans of Clash - Battle Royale","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27447.14353023909191715.96656a4c-13be-4fbd-a8ae-8e873f60125b.d2c5af36-7423-42b0-ad48-6701252dc43f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1387.14353023909191715.96656a4c-13be-4fbd-a8ae-8e873f60125b.181aa54c-40a8-40a1-80c3-b943bb04006a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["46658CrazyLabsLogicGames.ClansofClash-BattleRoyale_9crxbt5as2fvp"],"ContentIds":["9fba659e-fbf9-ad7f-d674-6198b76765ca","068c17db-bb0d-198f-8ac9-fe4605db11fa"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Clans of Clash - Battle Royale is an exciting royale battle and castle defense game with Superheroes!

You can rotate each ship and randomly place them by using the buttons.\r\nWhen you start playing Battleship War Strategy you need to press one of the squares on the other players grid where you want to fire a rocket towards. If you hit a ship you can keep taking another shot until you miss and then it will be the other players turn.
