We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.

If there’s one thing we know how to do is how to have terrific garage sales! There is a saying that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure which we believe is very true. So, today we are organizing a neighborhood Garage Sale. This annual event has become a drawing card for treasure hunters from all over the town, where everyone can benefit as both a buyer and a seller.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that this garage sale is one of the most successful in the country. Karen, Sarah and Thomas are customers at our neighborhood garage sale. Consistently finding the good stuff at yard sales is their mission. Like any mission, it requires strategy. They have prepared themselves how to choose their target, plan their attack, assemble the necessary gear, and get in and out fast. They even made a map which lists locations and categories of what is being sold at each location.\r\n\r\nNow they are starting their search around the site for shopping and bargaining. A bargain is almost guaranteed on garage sales. But they need our help to find all the items that they will carry home.\r\n\r\nHidden Objects: Neighborhood Garage Sale is a free hidden object game on

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6SSZ56JN79","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Legend of Junior OL","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39718.14011975460559564.07ffdf50-b0c9-48a2-856a-0eddd84cef53.22e5c89e-1a9b-4b2e-a83f-3e37425aadbf","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39525.14011975460559564.07ffdf50-b0c9-48a2-856a-0eddd84cef53.9f63d445-cd5f-415c-abd7-d4f379c787a3","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12405ZhiHao.LegendofJuniorOL_de0kdy9crh9ym"],"ContentIds":["57417ac8-4dfd-911f-10f2-45b9b5c256e5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The application does not support Windows 10S\r\n\r\nLegend of Junior OL is an original ARPG gameIt focuses in mythological themes and cute high definition graphics instead of a historically accurate depiction of the theme.

This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors.

But the more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations of the owners, the more complicated and unclear this case becomes.\r\n\r\nTRY IT FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM WITHIN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nA rookie inspector on her first assignment and her experienced copartner arrive at the scene – a luxurious island in the middle of the ocean owned by a young millionaire, who wants the matter concluded as quietly as possible. The question in this case appears simple enough:  was a security guard's death a suicidal plunge, or maybe an unfortunate fall? \r\nThe residents of the island - the Bradford family - at first seem cordial and beyond reproach, even shocked by the death of a friendly employee.
