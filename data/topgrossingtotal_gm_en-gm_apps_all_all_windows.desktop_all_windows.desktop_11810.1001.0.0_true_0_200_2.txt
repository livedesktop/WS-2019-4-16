It includes 16 thoughtfully designed fun games, containing very colorful and attractive images/sounds. Kids enjoy playing these games for hours without getting bored, and at the same time learning skills, which are carefully incorporated in the design of each game. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this app special is that so many different types of games are present in a single place, which are normally found in separate different apps.\r\n\r\nGames are designed to enhance following skills:\r\n  1. Basic mathematics\r\n  2. Numbers recognition\r\n  3. Hand-eye coordination\r\n  4. Concentration\r\n  5. Visual perception\r\n  6. Vocabulary\r\n  7. Classification\r\n  8. Symmetry\r\n  9. Organizing\r\n 10. Memory\r\n 11. Matching\r\n 12.

If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

We wanted to do the same thing. Unfortunately, we found that using an MP3 player or iPhone for this purpose was very awkward. We would often start the wrong song or have a hard time seeing the song titles. It was also a chore to \"train\" teammates to be the \"D.J.\" \r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\nThis app solves this problem. Each of the buttons is large and easy to see. You can pick the correct song each time, no matter how big your fingers are. Since the songs are named and organized in the filesystem, not the app, there is no data entry or creating of playlists required.

Edit. Share. Smile. The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. \r\n\r\nJoin millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.\r\n\r\nUse Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE LOOKS:\r\n\r\n* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.\r\nBORDERS:\r\n\r\n* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. Express yourself!\r\nEDIT PHOTOS:\r\n\r\n* Quickly open photos from the device.\r\n* Snap pictures from right within the app.\r\n* Edit photos to their possible best. An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.\r\n* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.\r\n\r\nCROP:\r\n\r\n* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\n* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nMake your photos pop with simple sliders:\r\n\r\n* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze\r\nUse these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. \r\nContrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.\r\nAdjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.\r\nAdjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.\r\nUse the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.\r\n\r\n* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites\r\nYou can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.\r\nUse Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.\r\n\r\n* Temperature and Tint\r\nUse Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.\r\nUse the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.\r\nUse the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo.

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft.

Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

Write music, using your digital pen*, and StaffPad will transform your handwritten notation into a beautifully typeset score which you can then edit, play back, print and share. For composers and musicians, StaffPad revolutionises the art of writing music.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTE: STAFFPAD **REQUIRES** A DEVICE WITH ACTIVE PEN CAPABILITIES. DESIGNED FOR SURFACE.\r\n\r\nMUSIC RECOGNITION\r\nStaffPad has been designed from the ground up for pen input. Simply write your music straight on to the screen, using your device’s pen. As you move from bar to bar, StaffPad will convert your handwriting into a beautifully engraved score. You can draw notes, beams, stems, articulations, accidentals, slurs, ties and more. It’s the most natural way to write music on digital device, ever.\r\n\r\nAN ORCHESTRA IN THE TIP OF YOUR PEN\r\nStaffPad contains a bespoke playback engine, and an entire orchestra which has been meticulously recorded and programmed to play back your score with incredible realism. Multiple dynamics layers, multiple recorded articulations, repetition samples and smart playback rules ensure that what you see is what you hear. The entire symphony orchestra is represented, and more instruments are available to purchase from the in-app store.\r\n\r\nStaffPad is powerful. Everything from a basic piano lead sheet to a full symphony score can be written with StaffPad.\r\n\r\nA BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE\r\nWriting music should be the focus of a composer. StaffPad handles everything else for you whilst you work. The interface has been designed to reduce clutter, and is context sensitive - showing only the information you want, when you want it.\r\n\r\nPEN AND TOUCH\r\nBy combining the power of digital inking and multitouch, we can offer a no-compromises approach to virtual manuscript. Use your finger to move around the score, and pinch to zoom - with butter-smooth scrolling. When you want to write music, just use the pen. Use your eraser button on the pen to remove both ink strokes and existing notation. You can also draw freehand on the score, using the sketch layer, to quickly brainstorm and leave notes/comments for yourself and others.\r\n\r\nPRINT YOUR RESULTS\r\nStaffPad will intelligently layout the score when it’s time to print. You can print the entire score, as well as individual parts for each musician. StaffPad has smart collision avoidance and music layout rules which handle the reflowing of the music to a page-based layout automatically.\r\n\r\nSHARE YOUR WORK\r\nStaffPad allows you to easily share and export your work. You can export MIDI and MusicXML, should you wish to continue working on your score in other programs. You can also export your score to MP3/WAV format, or quickly email an MP3 of your work in just a couple of taps. StaffPad also supports import of MusicXML and MIDI files.\r\n\r\nSCORE SYNC AND AUTO-SAVE\r\nStaffPad is always saving your score, and keeping track of versions - which you can return to at anytime. By saving your scores to OneDrive, you can ensure that your scores are kept in sync across all your devices. StaffPad also syncs your settings and preferences. You can also organise your scores into ‘collections’, meaning that your scores and projects stay neatly organised, for easy access. You can even pin frequently accessed scores straight to the Start Screen.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSER ASSISTANT\r\nA voice activated composer assistant allows you to interact with your score using your voice. Want to change the key signature to G major at bar 10? No problem - tap the assistant and say \"Change to G major at bar 10\". The assistant can quickly help you set up your score, adding instruments, setting the tempo, the key signature, the time signature, adding barlines, playing from rehearsal marks or specific bars, printing, exporting and transposing your score. Currently, the voice assistant is available in US and UK English only.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nStaffPad is the first notation application which allows you to easily draw dynamics/music expression data right onto the staff. By toggling the expression layer, you can elegantly draw in additional dynamics detail, which can enhance the realism of playback without compromising the existing dynamics markings on your score.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL FEATURES\r\nStaffPad intelligently handles transposing instruments, allowing you to write in concert pitch and toggle to transposing when you’re ready, or when printing. You can write music in multiple voices, transpose selections, reverse stem directions, quickly repeat bars and insert text intuitively via the  quick input tiles. Quick symbols provide the easiest way to enter trills, tremolos, fermatas, rehearsal marks, pedal markings, hairpins and much more.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\nStaffPad is designed for professional composers and musicians, but it’s also a great learning tool for students. Within the application there are multiple video tutorials explaining how to use the app, and key musical concepts. \r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nStaffPad REQUIRES a device with a digital pen (also known as an active digitiser) and multitouch capabilities in order to function as designed*. If your device does not support pen and touch, the app will not function correctly. Support will not be available to users attempting to run StaffPad on an incompatible device.\r\n\r\n*StaffPad has been designed for Surface 3, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH515BD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":" Halo Wars 2: Standard Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7936.13510798887619155.1152921504720025064.9e7079a2-4bc6-4c9a-867f-39e6b36173e5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6988.13510798887619155.1152921504738974806.c79207fe-4a44-4acc-81ba-2fcd916fa119","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53461.13510798887619155.1152921504738972017.5326d79a-5563-43b1-9249-9ae75fd10bd2","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$39.99⁺","Price":39.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"It’s the Halo experience you’ve dreamed of – controlling entire armies of Marines, Warthogs, Scorpion tanks, and Spartans on the battlefield from the Commander’s point of view.
